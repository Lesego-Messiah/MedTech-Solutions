        <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
        <img src="dr 2.jpeg" alt="Disaster Recovery Image 1">
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> The disaster recovery plan aims to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a disaster. It ensures continuity of hospital operations and covers preventive, detective, and corrective measures relevant to the hospital’s IT infrastructure.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2><b>Preventive Measures</b></h2>
        <img src="dr 4.jpeg" alt="Disaster Recovery Image 2">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regular Data Backups:</b> Automate daily backups of critical data, stored both locally and remotely. Test backups regularly to confirm data accessibility and integrity.</li>
            <li><b>Anti-Malware and Antivirus Software:</b> Install and update antivirus and antimalware software on all hospital systems. Conduct regular scans to detect and eliminate threats.</li>
            <li><b>Network Security Protocols:</b> Use firewalls and secure routers to prevent unauthorized access to the hospital’s network. Update firmware and software regularly to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><b>User Access Controls:</b> Enforce role-based access control, limiting access to sensitive data based on job responsibilities. Enforce strong password policies and periodic changes.</li>
            <li><b>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and Redundant Systems:</b> Install UPS systems to prevent data loss during power outages. Maintain redundant systems to ensure availability during primary system failures.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2><b>Detective Measures</b></h2>
        <img src="disaster recovery 1.jpeg" alt="Disaster Recovery Image 3">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</b> Monitor network traffic for unusual activities and notify IT staff of potential breaches.</li>
            <li><b>Regular Audits and Vulnerability Assessments:</b> Conduct quarterly audits of security protocols and systems to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><b>Log Monitoring:</b> Centralize logging of network activities to detect unusual behaviors such as large data transfers or failed login attempts. Set up alerts for abnormal activity.</li>
            <li><b>Employee Awareness and Training:</b> Regularly train staff on security best practices, phishing awareness, and how to report suspicious activities.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2><b>Corrective Measures</b></h2>
        <img src="dr 3.jpeg" alt="Disaster Recovery Image 4">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Incident Response Plan:</b> Create a structured plan outlining how to identify, isolate, and contain incidents. Assign clear roles to IT staff for effective response.</li>
            <li><b>Data Restoration from Backups:</b> Develop clear procedures for restoring data from the latest backups. Regularly test the restoration process to ensure efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>System Recovery and Reconfiguration:</b> Document the steps to reset affected systems and bring them back online according to hospital guidelines.</li>
            <li><b>Communication During Recovery:</b> Keep stakeholders informed about recovery progress, expected downtime, and alternative procedures during the recovery period.</li>
            <li><b>Post-Incident Review:</b> Conduct a detailed review of the incident to determine root causes, evaluate the response, and identify lessons learned. Update the disaster recovery plan accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conclusion, these preventive, detective, and corrective measures provide a solid framework for safeguarding hospital data, ensuring IT security, and maintaining operational continuity in case of disasters.</p>
